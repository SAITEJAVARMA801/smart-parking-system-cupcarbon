# smart-parking-system-cupcarbon
This project demonstrates a **multi-node Smart Parking System** designed using **CupCarbon IoT Simulator**, **ESP32**, and **ESP8266** boards.   Each parking spot acts as an IoT node that detects car presence, communicates status through MQTT, and displays it via LEDs and dashboards.
