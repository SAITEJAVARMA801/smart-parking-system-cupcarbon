# Smart-parking-system-cupcarbon
This project demonstrates a Multi-node Smart Parking System designed using CupCarbon IoT Simulator, ESP32, and ESP8266 boards.   Each parking spot acts as an IoT node that detects car presence, communicates status through MQTT, and displays it via LEDs and dashboards.

Urban areas often face parking congestion due to poor space visibility.  
The **Smart Parking System** solves this by continuously monitoring each parking slot and sharing live updates with a central dashboard.

In this implementation:
- 10 parking nodes are created:
  - **Parking Spots 1‚Äì3** ‚Üí Based on **ESP32** with **NEO Pixels**
  - **Parking Spots 4‚Äì5** ‚Üí Based on **ESP8266** with **NEO Pixels**
  - **Parking Spots 6‚Äì10** ‚Üí Based on **ESP32** with **RGB LED**
  
- Each node detects the vehicle using ultrasonic  and sends MQTT messages to indicate the status simulated using **CupCarbon** and  Central computer **Terminal**

Real-time parking space monitoring  
###  ESP32 with NeoPixel Array
(Used in Parking Spots 1‚Äì3)

- Uses **Adafruit NeoPixel** RGB LED strip for colorful, dynamic visual feedback.  
- Each LED pixel can represent a **parking slot state** with smooth transitions.  
- Detects vehicle presence using ultrasonic sensors.  
- Communicates over **Wi-Fi** with MQTT broker for centralized updates.  
- CupCarbon simulation reflects the data transmission from ESP32 to MQTT.  
- Offers **multi-color animations** for status feedback:
  - Green ‚Üí Slot Free  
  - Red ‚Üí Occupied / Reserved Occupied  
  - Blue ‚Üí Device Not Connected  
  - Magenta ‚Üí Reserved Free 
  - White ‚Üí Connection status / system ready  


### üîµ ESP32 with RGB LED
(Used in Parking Spots 6‚Äì10 for design simulation)

- Uses a **standard RGB LED** with three digital pins for R, G, and B control.  
- Simpler setup representing low-cost deployment.  
- Each slot indicates state through color mixing (no pixel animation).  
- Also simulated in **CupCarbon** for virtual monitoring.  
- Ideal for scaling to more parking nodes with less power consumption.

### ‚ö™ ESP8266 Nodes (Spots 4‚Äì5)
Built using ESP8266 (NodeMCU) boards with Open Smart NeoPixel (WS2812B) LED arrays.

Function as fully active parking nodes.

Detect vehicle presence via ultrasonic sensors and display status with vivid NeoPixel colors.

Communicate wirelessly with the MQTT broker over Wi-Fi for live status updates.

Provide the same four color states as ESP32 nodes for a consistent visual experience.

Integrated into the CupCarbon simulation for synchronized virtual-physical testing.

## üåç CupCarbon Simulation

All 10 parking nodes are represented in **CupCarbon**, forming a smart parking network:
- Virtual IoT nodes correspond to physical devices.
- MQTT packets flow between simulated nodes and broker.

CupCarbon provides a visual layout of the city parking area with connected sensors and wireless communication lines.

## üí° Status Indication System

| Status | NeoPixel Color | RGB LED Color | Description |
|---------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Free | üü¢ Green | Green | Slot available |
| Occupied | üî¥ Red | Red | Vehicle detected |
| Reserved Free | üîµ Blue | Blue | Device not connected in Neo pixel/ Slot reserved but empty in RGB LED |
| Reserved Occupied | üü£ Magenta| Yellow | Reserved free |
| System Ready | ‚ö™ White | ‚Äî | Initialization / connected |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. Sensors detect the presence of a car in each slot.  
2. ESP32 processes the data and updates LED color accordingly.  
3. Status is published to the MQTT topic (e.g., `parking/spot/1`).  
4. CupCarbon simulates message transfer between all virtual nodes.  
5. Dashboard or broker receives and displays the combined parking map.
